Poll App (Django)

## If you want to Run the app, follow the instructions:

I’ll assume you have installed Django already. You can tell Django is installed and which version by running the following command in a shell prompt (indicated by the \$ prefix):

```
$ python -m django --version
```

If Django is installed, you should see the version of your installation. If it isn’t, you’ll get an error telling “No module named django”. Which means you can go to this link: [How to install Django](~https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/install/~)
